// 1. Introduction and Goals
[[section-introduction-and-goals]]
== Introduction and Goals
The Poker Bro is a software to analyze previously played poker hands and provide the possibility to review all actions step by step. Several statistics are collected to give the reviewer an idea about the oppenents on table.

=== Requirements Overview
The Poker Bro's use cases are clearly after playing a hand. It's not intended to display statistics live as on overlay on the table. The main features are:

- Importing of hand history files to common format (json)
- Storing hand history in long term
- Possibility to replay single hands
- Overview of profit and losses, profitable starting hands, etc
- Additional statistics for villains, like starting hand range
- Statistical calculations like profitability of calls

Many more features can be implemented, also including artificial intelligence to make suggestions and improve the game of the hero. 

=== Quality Goals

[options="header",cols="1,7,16"]
|===
|Nr.|Goal|Motivation
| 1 | Fast hand history interpretation | After finishing a hand the next one is immediatly starting. With The Poker Bro the hero should be able to analyze a hand directly after is is finished. The timeframe from processing the textfile with hand history until it shows up in the gui must not be longer than 5 seconds.
| 2 | No hand data loss | Every hand is important to build statistics and allows to understand if the hero is playing poker profitable or not.
| 3 | Add additional poker rooms | Additional or new poker rooms can easily adopted to the ecosystem
| 4 | Cloud ready | In principle The Poker Bro should be runnable in a public cloud. An exception is only allowed for the shipper which imports hand history. This Quality Goal is mainly driven by the stakeholder software architect.
| 5 | Easy to use | The ui of The Poker Bro is easy to use and follows common design und usability criterias.

=== Stakeholders

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
|Role/Name|Expectations
| _Poker Player_ | As a poker player I want to review and analyze my plays. This is mainly done when finished playing but sometimes a replay should be able just after the hand is finished.  
| _Software Architect_ | As a software architect I want to learn something new. Interest are mainly in cloud technologies and several programming languages. The PokerBro app is used as a real life scenario to build knowledge and having fun in trying something new.

== System Scope and Context
This chapter describes the environment and context of The Poker Bro. Who's the user of it and what are systems it's depending on.

=== Business Context
image:businessContext.png[Business Context] 

**Poker Player (Hero)**

The Hero is the user user of The Poker Bro. He plays poker at poker rooms like pokerstars and is interested to improve his game. Additional to theretical learning he analysis his decisions after playing.

**Other Poker Players (Villains)**

**Poker Room (Pokerstars)**

The poker room provides a platform to bring the hero and villains together and play poker against each other. All around money handling and play is concentrated here and not part of The Poker Bro.

**Hand History**

The hand history is a text document of every dealt hand on a poker room, in which the hero is involved. It protocols every step (bet, call, raise, flop cards) in a humand readable format on disk. The Poker Bro using it as data source.

**External Systems**

Third party systems should be used to avoid implementation of equity calculations. Different use cases are possible and the app can be extended.
