A poker review software with the purpose to try cloud technologies in specific use case. It should allow to review your pokerplaying afterwards in a brwoser.


# General Information
I am aware of the fact that there is software on the market to review and analyze poker games. Main target of the project is not to have just another tool, but to deal specifically with modern cloud related technology. So some decisions are made from the point of view of learning something new, even if other solutions seem easier.
